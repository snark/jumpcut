# Changelog

Jumpcut predates the widespread adoption of semantic versioning; as such,
pre-1.0 releases are numbered as 0.XX.

## Unreleased
### Fixed
- Jumpcut no longer crashes when "Clear All" is selected but there are no
clippings on the stack.
- We restore the Jumpcut bezel's ability to appear in any space when using
Spaces.

## [0.80] - 2022-04-24
### Rewritten
- Jumpcut has been rewritten in Swift 5. As my day job is not writing code for
Macs (or Apple devices of any kind), my ability to work with Jumpcut's aging
code base was starting to dwindle; when I hit bugs, workarounds in Stack
Overflow often presumed use of Swift. This change will hopefully preserve
Jumpcut as an approachable, maintainable code base (for me and others!) for
years to come.
### Changed
- Target macOS/OS X version is now 10.11 (permanently, this time).
- New icon by John Kenzie. Thanks, Johnny!
- Switch to mainline (non-forked) version of ShortcutRecord. 
- Jumpcut now uses Swift Package Manager instead of vendored libraries for
Sparkle and ShortcutRecorder.
- We now use the HotKey, Preference, and Sauce Swift libraries.
### Fixed
- Improved support for non-QWERTY keyboards and detection of keyboard layout
changes via the Sauce library.
- Improved detection of missing Accessibility access, including alerting on
startup.
### Added
- "Headless" mode, with no display of a menu icon. Double-click the application
icon to open the preference window (and disable headless mode if so desired).
- "Additional options" in the menu, currently limited to explicit
copy-to-pasteboard, paste, and delete.
- "Toggle" behavior in the menu, switching to whichever of copy-to-pasteboard
or paste is *not* the current preference.
- "Reset Preferences" button, restoring factory default preferences (and
removing the necessity of editing settings in the command line to undo "don't
warn me again choices).
- Configurable bezel text alignment.

## [0.75] - 2021-06-30
### Fixed
- Altered the check for transient types (and, optionally, concealed
types) to use a less brittle method that does not require actually
loading the pasteboard item. (Thanks to GitHub users acca and
maybeageek for the bug reports.)
- Target macOS/OS X version has been set back to 10.10 from 10.11.
### Added
- The "Clear All" menu item's warning may now be disabled. (Set
the "askBeforeClearingClippings" preference back to true to
re-enable it if needed.)

## [0.74] - 2021-05-31
### Added
- Jumpcut is now a universal binary and will run natively on Intel
and Apple Silicon Macs.

## [0.73] - 2020-10-10
### Fixed
- Improved detection of Jumpcut-created clips to prevent re-adding
them to the clipping stack. (Thanks to GitHub user Web-Betty for
the bug report and screencast.)
### Added
- Individual clips may now be deleted by pressing the delete key or
backspace when the clip is displayed in the bezel.

## [0.72] - 2020-02-20
### Fixed
- Fixed issue preventing default hotkey (Control-Option-V) from being set
for first-time users.
- Jumpcut has updated to use the most recent ShortcutRecorder code
as of February 2020; while the fork previously in use worked correctly
on Macs running 10.13 (High Sierra) and later, a crashing bug was
reported when setting the master hotkey on Sierra (duplicated on El
Capitan). Using the mainline ShortcutRecorder (v3.1, from October 2019)
has resolved this issue on El Capitan, where the hotkey may not be set
normally.
- keyCodeToString crashed when using Hiragana and Katakana keyboards;
this code has been made more defensive and should work more robustly for
non-Roman keyboards. (Update: this change also fixed a similar bug with
Pinyin keyboards.) Thanks to Darren Gore for the initial bug report and
assistance with reproduction and testing.
### Added
- "Bezel selection pastes" and "menu selection pastes" are once again
separate items in the general preferences.

## [0.71] - 2019-09-19
### Fixed
- Display resolution changes now trigger adjustments to bezel size and
positioning, meaning that Jumpcut does not need to be restarted to have
a normal bezel after adding or removing a monitor.
- The version of ShortcutRecorder used by Jumpcut was too old to have Mojave
styling or Dark Mode support; some assets have been brought back from the
upstream project to provide this. Snow Leopard styling has been dropped. The
recorder is now legible in Dark Mode.
- Removed some blank Info.plist values causing problems in Activity Monitor;
Jumpcut was not displaying or displaying with no listed name, just the icon.
- Edge case: typing the active hotkey while _setting_ the hotkey no longer
activates the bezel.
- Very large clippings (such as Moby Dick) no longer cause discernable lag
time when viewed in the bezel
- Sparkle auto-updater now runs properly on launch if the checkbox has been
checked. (Previously, due to a misreading of the Sparkle docs, it was not
activating.)
### Changed
- Jumpcut now targets versions of macOS/OS X 10.11 (El Capitan) and later
- Minimum number of clips to remember is now a more sane 10 instead of 1

## [0.70] - 2019-09-01
### Fixed
- 64-bit compatible; now runs without warning under Mojave
- Corrected behavior for Command-V emission on non-American keyboards
- Known transient sources of content (such as TypeIt4Me and TextExpander) are now ignored
- Rewrote Launch on Login to support modern macOS requirements
### Added
- Restored “Clear All” menu item
- Accessibility entailment for modern macOS security concerns
- Retina-ready “Jumpcut logo” menu bar icon
- Dark mode support for menu bar icon
- Option to ignore known sources of sensitive data, such as KeePassXC or 1Password
### Removed
- Dropped (regrettably) outdated German and French localizations
- Support for pre-High Sierra macOS
- Dropped Credits preference panel in favor of credits embedded in the About
menu
- Dropped Appearance menu sliders for adjusting bezel transparency
### Changed
- Updated to ShortcutRecord2
- Pointed all references to SourceForge at Github

## [0.63] - 2009-01-26
### Fixed
- When using Spaces, bezel window now appears in active Space rather than
reverting to the first Space it was used in; revised tooltips in preferences
window

## [0.62] - 2008-05-11
### Added
- Paste support for Dvorak and international keyboard users
- New wraparound option in bezel interface
### Changed
- Updated ShortcutRecorder and Sparkle libraries

## [0.61] - 2007-02-25
### Added
- Launch on login preference
### Changed
- Updated ShortcutRecorder and Sparkle libraries

## [0.6] - 2006-06-12
### Added
-  Preference for menu items to paste directly rather than simply inserting
themselves into the pasteboard
- Now using ShortcutRecorder for improved hotkey selection
- Now using Sparkle automatic-update framework
- "Sticky Bezel" option
- Appearance preference pane
### Changed
