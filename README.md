About

Jumpcut is a clipboard manager for macOS, providing access to text that
you've cut or copied, even if you've subsequently cut or copied something
else.

Jumpcut has a lightweight, intuitive interface and is 100% focused on
your clipboard, keeping code snippets, email addresses, URLs, and that
sentence that you actually had _just right_ five minutes ago close to hand.

Note that Jumpcut uses git submodules rather than Cocoapods or Carthage
to include the ShortcutRecorder framework; as such, cloning should use the
`--recurse-submodules` flag.
