<p>Jumpcut is open source code built with open source code. Jumpcut incorporates the following libraries, used with gratitude:
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/Kentzo/ShortcutRecorder">ShortcutRecorder 2</a> by Ilya Kulakov et al.</li>
        <li>Sparkle by <a href="https://www.andymatuschak.org/">Andy Matuschak</a></li>
        <li>UKPrefsPanel by <a href="https://orangejuiceliberationfront.com/">Uli Kusterer</a></li>
    </ul>
    <br>Additionally, much of the original code for Jumpcut was derived from <a href="http://inessential.com/">Brett Simmons</a>' TigerLaunch and constant referral to the examples and discussion at <a href="https://cocoadev.github.io/all.html">CocoaDev.com</a>; the launch on login behavior was adapted from LaunchAtLogin by <a href="https://blog.timschroeder.net/">Tim Schröder</a>.
