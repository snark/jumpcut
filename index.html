    <h2>Note to Upgraders</h2>
    <p>
        Users upgrading from 0.63 have reported issues with the Accessibility
        tab of the &ldquo;Security &amp; Preferences&rdquo; Preferences panel,
        which is required to make the paste functionality work. <mark>If
        Jumpcut is not pasting</mark> despite the &ldquo;Clipping selection
        pastes&rdquo; preference being checked in Jumpcut, please
        <a href="./accessibility.html">see here</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Using Jumpcut</h2>
    <p>
        Jumpcut is designed to be simple. Move the Jumpcut application (the
        one with the pretty scissors icon) to your Applications directory.
        Launch Jumpcut. A scissors icon will appear in your menu bar. Now
        whenever you cut or copy a text item, it&rsquo;ll be added to the
        &ldquo;stack&rdquo; of clippings that Jumpcut has recorded.
    </p>

    <p>
        To get at a clipping, choose one from under the Jumpcut menu item.
        Or, set a global hotkey (from the Preferences menu) and begin using
        Jumpcut via keyboard. (The default value for this hotkey is <mark>
        Command + Option + V</mark>.) Typing it will bring up a pop-up bezel,
        similiar to the application switcher. Hold the modifier keys (Command
        and Option by default) and use the arrow keys or the non-modifier key
        (V, by default) to scroll through the stack. (Shift plus the non-modifier
        key scrolls in reverse. Release all keys to select the clipping, or
        hit Escape to cancel.
    </p>

    <p>
        When you&rsquo;ve selected a clipping, Jumpcut will put it on the
        pasteboard and attempt to paste it into your application. It does
        this by mimicking a user typing Command-V. (As such, the first time
        you run Jumpcut, <mark>you&rsquo;ll be prompted by macOS to give
        Jumpcut access to type into other programs</mark>.  If this access
        is not given or the &ldquo;Clipping selection pastes&rdquo;
        in preference in Jumpcut is unchecked, the clipping will still be
        put on your pasteboard and you can paste manually. (If you change
        your mind, you can add Jumpcut in the Accessibility pane of the
        &ldquo;Security &amp; Privacy&rdquo; System Preference manually.)
        Read more about <a href="./accessibility.html">accessibilty</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Jumpcut remembers the last clipping you selected using the bezel. The
        next time you bring the bezel up, it will start with that clipping
        unless it&rsquo;s scrolled off the stack.
    </p>

    <h2>Additional Behavior</h2>
    <p>
        Some users may prefer to use a &quot;sticky bezel&quot;; if this
        preference is enabled, you must hit return to select a clipping or
        escape to dismiss the bezel once it is activated.
    </p>

    <h2>Not Using Jumpcut</h2>
    <p>
        Not for you? You might want to try out other open source macOS
        clipboard managers, such as <a href="https://maccy.app">Maccy</a>
        or <a href="https://clipy-app.com">Clipy</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Contributing to Jumpcut</h2>
    <p>
        I review pull requests and issues filed and welcome questions or
        suggestions, but Jumpcut is a hobbyist project and releases should
        be expected to be infrequent.
    </p>

    <h2>Miscellania</h2>
    <p>
        A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_cut">&ldquo;jump
        cut&rdquo;</a> is a film editing technique in which two shots
        of the same subject matter from slightly different angles are
        shown sequentially, creating an effect of jumping forward in
        time. Jumpcut is designed to move your clipboard <em>backward</em>
        in time, but it&rsquo;s a nice name for a lightweight clipboard
        manager, and I like both <em>Breathless</em> and
